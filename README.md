ðŸŒŸ FORGED IN FIRE ðŸŒŸ
"The Makerâ€™s Soul"
by Shadow

I took pain and welded it into purpose,
Hammered doubt until it bent to will.
In darkness, I forged my quiet furnace,
Where broken sleep kept engines still.

I turned sleepless nights into spinning spindles,
Fed hope through wires and rusted gears.
Each failure taught the art of patience,
Each spark outshined a thousand fears.

I gave up comfort to gain creation,
Traded ease for burning flame.
My dreams refused to die in silence,
So I carved them into name.

Each bolt, each wire, holds a piece of me,
Not just metal, but memory and might.
Time became my greatest investment,
As I turned burden into flight.

They called it madness â€” I called it vision,
A blueprint written in blood and fire.
Now my machine hums with my rhythm,
The echo of a lone desire.

I turned love into ambition,
And ambition into motion's fire.






"I took pain and welded it into purpose.
I turned sleepless nights into spinning spindles.
I gave up comfort to gain creation.
My idea refused to stay silent â€” so I built it a voice.
Each bolt, each wire, holds a piece of my soul.
Time wasn't wasted â€” it was invested.
What they called madness, I called a blueprint.
My machine is not just metal â€” itâ€™s my life moving in real time.
I turned love into ambition, and ambition into motion."

â€” Shadow

"I donâ€™t just build machines â€”
I give metal a soul,
motion a meaning,
and silence a voice."

draw dreams in code,
and let the machine finish the sentence I began."
